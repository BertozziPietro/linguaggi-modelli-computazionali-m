_There are so many languages, how can I choose?_ \
_Better fast or precise? Put yourself in my shoes!_ \
_C was my first love, but now feels so cold,_ \
_Rust whispers safety, its virtues retold._ \
_What if I dare and build one of my own?_ \
_Would it sing in the sun or crumble like stone?_ \
_Python’s my crutch; I use it for all,_ \
_yet JavaScript’s webs still call and enthrall._ \
_Kotlin’s concise, Swift’s clean and clear,_ \
_while Go carves paths engineers hold dear._ \
_Yet, in this chaos, one truth I hold tight:_ \
_the best language depends on the task in sight._
